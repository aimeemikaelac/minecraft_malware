##Cuckoo

To use with cuckoo, place the classloader.py module into the modules/packages directory of whatever VM target you are using (e.g., Linux), as well as the dependencies, such as the strace analyzer python code. The target VM has to have the scanner.jar Java scanner installed inside of it (and this installation path is currently hardcoded in the classloader.py module), as well as Java 7 and strace (at /usr/bin/strace). Make sure that the VM (eg a KVM VM) is configured to boot off of the correct snapshot in the cuckoo config and that it has a static IP. This VM also has to have the cuckoo agent installed and running (the agent.py python script). Also, the snapshot has to be a live snapshot so that the VM is running when cuckoo restores this snapshot - therefore, the cuckoo agent does not have to be run as a service, but it is easier to create an upstart service to launch it at boot anyway.

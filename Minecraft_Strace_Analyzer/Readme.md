##Cuckoo

To use with cuckoo, place the classloader.py module into the modules/packages directory of whatever VM target you are using (e.g., Linux), as well as the dependencies, such as the strace analyzer python code. The target VM has to have the scanner.jar Java scanner installed inside of it (and this installation path is currently hardcoded in the classloader.py module), as well as Java 7 and strace (at /usr/bin/strace).
